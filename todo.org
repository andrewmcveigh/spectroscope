* what's missing is

  - working out current ns map

  - keeping a record of current namespace mapping through defs and
    aliases

  - less naive version of ^^ i.e., one that expands macros, and
    doesn't just look at top-level forms.

  - more flexible reader, i.e., only reading, nothing other than
    read, no ns resolve, no record construct, no read-eval, etc.

  - get source of macros looking for 'def'-like forms

  - if we see 'def'-like forms, attempt to expand macros we can prove
    to be pure

  - any forms with 'def'-likes need to be examined
